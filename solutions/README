Description:

Assorted solutions to machine learning problems guided by Jason Brownlee's 
blog machine learning mastery, created in the interest of self-study and
familiarization with the specialization. 

Note:

Each problem should contain it's own independent folder named accordingly. 
Additionally, each problem should also have its own report document named
similarily found in the documentation folder. 

Each problem should have a standard subfolder "data" that contains a
.data file. The .names file may also be included for supplemental dataset
information.
